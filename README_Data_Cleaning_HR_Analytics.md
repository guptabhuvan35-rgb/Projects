# Data Cleaning using Pandas - HR Analytics

Student: Bhuvan Gupta

## Objective
Clean and visualise an HR dataset, handling placeholders, invalid values, corrupt dates, duplicates, and inconsistent categories.

## Files
- `Data_Cleaning_using_Pandas_HR_Analytics.ipynb` - Complete Jupyter notebook with code and explanations (use PyCharm's Jupyter support to open).
- `Data Cleaning for HR Analytics v1.csv` - The dataset used (kept at original path).

## How to run
1. Open the notebook `Data_Cleaning_using_Pandas_HR_Analytics.ipynb` in PyCharm (Professional or Community with Jupyter plugin).
2. Ensure the CSV path exists at:

```
E:\Top Mentor - Data Science\Projects\Project - Data Analytics using Python\Data Cleaning using Pandas\HR Analytics\Data Cleaning for HR Analytics v1.csv
```

3. Run cells top-to-bottom. The notebook includes a fallback path so it can be run outside the E: drive for verification.

## Notes
- All explanations are included as `#` comments inside code cells per project requirements.
- No extra CSV exports are produced by the notebook.
