Submitted by: Bhuvan Gupta

Project: DAta Clenaing using Pandas - HEALTHCARE DATA ANALYTICS
Notebook file: DAta_Cleanaing_using_Pandas_HEALTHCARE_DATA_ANALYTICS.ipynb

Instructions to run:
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and PyCharm configured to use it.
2. Install required packages if missing:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib python-dateutil openpyxl
3. Place the dataset at the following exact path on your Windows 11 machine:
   E:\Top Mentor - Data Science\Projects\Project - Data Analytics using Python\Data Cleaning using Pandas\HEALTHCARE DATA ANALYTICS\healthcare_patient_data.csv
4. Open the notebook in PyCharm and run cells in order.
5. The notebook uses the fixed CSV_PATH variable and will read the dataset from the path above.
6. The notebook performs data cleaning, imputation (in-memory), and visualization. No CSV files are written by design.

Notes:
- All code explanations are provided as '#' comments just above the code they explain.
- The notebook is structured to be a single-file submission for evaluation.
